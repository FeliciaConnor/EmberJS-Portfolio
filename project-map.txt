Imagery:
  -Logo, Felikitty
    -Inspired by 1980's cartoon and video game branding, IE S.W.A.T KATS and Fatal Fury.
    -All color and textures designed in Photoshop using a wide variety of tools and techniques.
  -Album Art, 'Compendium'
    -Angular panorama effect learned through experimentation--no tutorials used in the making.
    -Techniques used include perspective-based skewing, classical photo editing techniques such as masking, cloning, and blending.
    -Employs a screening technique to give the appearance of an aged LP cover.
  -Album Art, 'Anthem of Anguish' (Halloween 2015)
    -Created primarily using compositing and a similar shifted-perspective technique seen in 'Compendium'
    -Uses several methods of filtering, dodging and burning, color correction and line-work to achieve an HP Lovecraft inspired aesthetic.
    -Makes use of color and elements of 'body horror' to achieve an unsettling aesthetic.

Music:
  -Portfolio Piece: Theme of Xintana
    -Made as a concept piece for an action RPG with a pre-Colombian aesthetic.
    -Uses a mix of synths, woodwinds, and tribal-influenced rhythms to reflect the lush nature depicted in concept art.
  -Remix: Satellite Young - Dividual Heart
    -Remix produced for Japan-based synthpop duo Satellite Young.
    -Features an entirely different aesthetic and chord structure from the original, while preserving the original vocals and solos.
  -Recent EP: In Bloom
    -A concept EP of eclectic instrumentals meant to convey the emotional progress experienced during transition.
    -Uses a variety of influences in each track to give a distinct emotional mood, IE jazz-waltz inspired drum beats.
